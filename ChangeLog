	* Remove 'print' debug, closes: #1474.

Version 0.1.0 Released on 2009/01/15

	* Initial release. Closes: #1284
	* Removed default vmlinuz and vmlinuz.old configuration from lilo base
	configuration as it may interfer with overwriting configuration. Maybe
	sjconf-lilo post-inst should propose to fill local configuration with
	/boot content as lilo package does
